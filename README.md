# Coordinates_Transform_GPS
A function transforms the GPS coordinates to the local North-East-Down (NED) frame.

The module is transformation_GPS.py.

The useage is shown in example.py. You can find some GPS coordinates for some specific points to test it.

The module is compatiable to Python2 and Python3, and has been tested in Parrot-Sphinx, a drone simulation platform developed by Parrot. I will upload the example for this software later.
