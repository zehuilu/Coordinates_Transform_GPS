# Coordinates_Transform_GPS
A function transforms the GPS coordinates to the local North-East-Down (NED) frame.
Reference: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/9780470099728.app3

The module is transformation_GPS.py.

The useage is shown in example.py. You can use the GPS coordinates for some specific points to test it.

The module is compatiable to Python2 and Python3, and has been tested in Parrot-Sphinx, a drone simulation platform developed by Parrot. I will upload an example for this software later.
